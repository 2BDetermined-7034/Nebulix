# Nebulix
A web-based application designed to automate the process of team trading requests. This application will enable a team member from an attending event to access the platform, input their trading information, and provide their contact details. The entered information will be forwarded to a Discord channel thread, where it will be visible to all team members.

Additionally, an interaction button will be provided to facilitate the claim of a trade request. Upon claiming the request, the bot will send a direct message to the user providing the contact information for the trade, thereby preventing multiple individuals from contacting the same person regarding a trade.
